h1. Coffee Grinder

CoffeeGrinder is a PHP compiler wrapper for "CoffeeScript":http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/ compilers. It's useful to dynamically compiling CoffeeScript on the server-side before serving to a client (as opposed to manually compiling scripts).

CoffeeGrinder should be used as part of an existing asset packaging system and is provided for convenience for being part of a larger system. CoffeeGrinder is not an independent CoffeeScript compiler. By default CoffeeGrinder uses "jcoffeescript":https://github.com/yeungda/jcoffeescript, however, this can be replaced with any compiler that takes CoffeeScript on STDIN and produces compiled code on STDOUT.


h2. Requirements

* PHP 5.3+
* Your favorite command line CoffeeScript compiler

h3. Usage

<pre>
